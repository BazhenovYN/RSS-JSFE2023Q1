Hello everyone, my name is Iurii. Although now I often have to introduce myself as "Ich heisse Iurii". But let me describe everything step by step. 

I was born and grew up in Ryazan, Russia. I've been fascinated by technology since childhood. So, my decision to build a career in the technical field was predetermined. I entered the Ryazan Radio Engineering University. It took a lot of effort, nerves and sleepless nights to study at university, but finally I got my diploma of computers engineer! And of course I started to build a career.

I got a job at a large construction company that implemented software written in 1C:Enterprise. 1C:Enterprise is a low-coding, full-featured platform, popular in Russia (SAP like). I started my journey in IT as a operations service specialist, I grew rapidly, and I soon realized that I had reached the top of my growth in this position. Soon I decided to change my job and got a job as a software developer at the Central Bank of Russia.

During 6 years of working in the bank I went from being an ordinary developer to the head of the development team. During this time I have gained experience not only in programming, but also in database design, business analysis, automated testing, building workflows, developing standards and best practices, and of course managing a team of developers.

I've worked on a lot of projects. I refactored code of a critical subsystem that was probably 99% spaghetti code, participated in the huge integration projects, but the most memorable experience for me was the development of a subsystem for the automation of accounting operations. It was the most ambitious task. Imagine, the task was to fully automate the work of hundreds of employees with a few clicks! At first it seemed simply impossible, but after several months of careful work and analysis, we managed to develop an innovative solution that led to positive  results. This task prooved that nothing is impossible if you do this step by step.

The main difficulty of each project was that there was no room for error. The smallest error could lead to the failure of other subsystems and paralyze the work of several thousand employees across the country. I am proud that my team and I managed to organize our work processes in a way that minimized the probability of critical errors and produced the highest quality software product possible.

Although I had great success in 1C, I wanted more: to go beyond the limits of a narrowly focused programming language, to study the global development practices. I thought for a long time about changing the direction of my activities and move into "real" development. I was excited by the idea. But I did not know how to begin and how to build my way in the study of the new sphere and not to get crazy because of huge amount of new information, and at least how to get practical experience. And here in my life came RSSchool. Althought, studying is not so easy, I enjoy it, I'm excited and I'm striving to became a web-developer. I even learned how to find a few more hours in the day for my education. And now I got an extra trigger to chage my career totaly. My family moved to Germany, to Berlin. Here the 1C:Enterprise software is not in demand, unlike the web-development. It's time to do it: to finish education and to get my first job as Web-developer! I belive that with the right help from mentors RSSchool, I'll do this! At least, I'm doing my best.

Thank you for your attention! Tsch√ºss!
